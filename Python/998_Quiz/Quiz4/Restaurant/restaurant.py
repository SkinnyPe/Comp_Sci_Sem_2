y = random.randrange(3)

x = ("Which out of the 3 restaurants would you like to go to (kfc, cpk, shakeshack)")
if x == rest_list[0]:
    print(kfc_menu)
I would have to make 3 if statements that also adds the random suggested menu item by making the random counter.
I would have to make the if statements equal to each list corresponding to each restaurant.
